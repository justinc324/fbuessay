  <h1>   Code doesn't live in a vacuum</h1>
  <p>How should software engineers think about the ethical impact of their work?</p>
</div>
<h3>“Dammit!”</h3>
<p>
&emsp;My friend Mateo was growing increasingly frustrated as he was trying to pass a test for one of our assignments: creating a simple HTTP server. 
His expletives grew louder, and the keyboard yelled for help as his typing became faster and faster, furiously testing his code over and over again. Eventually, he finally turned to me, exasperated.
</p>

<p>“Yo, can you check to see if I’m doing something wrong?</p>

<p>I walked over to him, hoping my limited experience could be of some use. After a few seconds of careful analysis, I looked at him and said:
</p>
<p>“You made your URL ‘/string’ instead of ‘/strings’.”
</p>
<p>&emsp;In developing software, it’s easy to get caught up in our work. Engineers engross themselves into fixing bugs such as this one, or in the fact that they are creating awesome, practical things from, quite literally, nothing. However, the code engineers develop don’t live in a vacuum.  Nor are they designed to be! Indeed, if the brilliant things we create are simply holed up on Cloud9 or on our computer, then what’s the point of making it? What good is it if our work if it is not intended not to impact lives in a positive way, make something more efficient, or help the world be more “open and connected”? 
</p>
<p>&emsp;However, the reality of living outside the vacuum is that the world is not a perfect utopia, developed to solely radiate positivity and noble intentions. Despite the well-meaning of a coder or software developer looking to make an impact, their work may be utilized in not so honorable ways. What might be the crowning achievement of an engineer’s career may turn into the bane of a teenager’s existence, filing through their Ask.fm on a lonely Friday night, rife of disgusting questions and horrendous suggestions, wondering if he/she should go through with them. Thus, developers can’t be content with just creating the code - they need to make sure their work will powerfully and positively impact this world, rather than degrade it. </p>
<p>&emsp;Such a task is difficult, however. Technology has developed at an extraordinary rate, to the point where our social norms and values have a hard time keeping up with it. As a result, it’s can hard to predict how nifty products and apps can become potentially dangerous - as was the case with <em>Ogle</em>, a campus-wide story feed that turned into a amalgam of <a href="http://www.presstelegram.com/technology/20160502/rep-linda-sanchez-sends-ogle-app-ceo-letter-asking-how-company-combatting-cyber-bullying">cyber-bullying</a> and <a href="http://www.ksbw.com/article/aptos-high-student-accused-of-threatening-4-schools/1296684">bomb threats.</a> What software engineers can do is learn from mistakes like these and apply them to their projects - it’s probably not a good idea to give people complete anonymity to post to their malicious heart’s desire without repercussions. When the potential negative uses and consequences for an app or website outweigh its potential benefit to society, it’s likely time to rethink whether that project should still be pursued. And unfortunately, there’s not a one-size-fit-all approach to this issue. It’s not always an issue of which list is longer: the pros or cons? Sometimes the impact of many potential questions might be overshadowed by a few benefits of the work - and vice versa.
</p>
<p>&emsp;Despite the difficulty of this ethical dilemma, once code leaves the confines of a developer's screen, it’s impact will be felt by potentially millions of people. It’s not an issue that can be simply swept to the side. It’s one that needs to be answered with careful thought, good judgement, and lessons learned from the mistakes of others. If we can keep these things in mind, I believe good, impactful work will come along naturally. Just remember - it’s easier to answer tough questions now, to yourself, than to answer these tough questions from thousands of people later.
