  <h1>   Code doesn't live in a vacuum</h1>
  <p>How should software engineers think about the ethical impact of their work?</p>
</div>
<h2>“Dammit!”</h2>
<p>
&emsp;My friend Mateo was growing increasingly frustrated as he was trying to pass a test for one of our assignments: creating a simple HTTP server. 
His expletives grew louder, and the keyboard yelled for help as his typing became faster and faster, furiously testing his code over and over again. Eventually, he finally turned to me, exasperated.
</p>

<p>“Yo, can you check to see if I’m doing something wrong?</p>

<p>I walked over to him, hoping my limited experience could be of some use. After a few seconds of careful analysis, I looked at him and said:
</p>
<p>“You made your URL ‘/string’ instead of ‘/strings’.”
</p>
&emsp;In developing software, it’s easy to get caught up in bugs such as this one, or in the fact that you are creating awesome, practical things from, quite literally, nothing. However, the code engineers develop don’t in a vacuum - nor are they designed to be! Indeed, if the brilliant things we create are simply holed up on Cloud9 or GitHub, then what’s the point of making it, if not to impact lives in a positive way, make something more efficient, or help the world be more “open and connected”? 
</p>
<p>&emsp;However, the reality of living outside the vacuum is that the world is not a perfect utopia, developed to radiate positivity and only noble intentions. Despite the well-meaning of a coder or software developer looking to make an impact, their work may be utilized in not so honorable ways. What might be the crowning achievement of an engineer’s career may turn into the bane of a teenager’s existence, filing through their Ask.fm on a lonely Friday night, rife of disgusting questions and horrendous suggestions, wondering if he/she should go through with them. Developers can’t be content with just creating the code - we need to make sure its impact 

Such a task is difficult. Technology has developed at an extraordinary rate, to the point where our social norms and values have a hard time keeping up. And though software engineers work magic every time they develop code, we don’t have a crystal ball that can show us all the potential misuses of our projects and software. But I believe we can alleviate 
 
I am not suggesting that software developers prepare for only the worst in people - if we took that approach, Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, among software would have never been developed, citing things such as the potential for the spread of fake news, cyber bullying, sexting, etc. </p>
